### Background:

You work at a startup that is building a new and disruptive platform called Fintech Finder. Fintech Finder is an application that its customers can use to find fintech professionals from among a list of candidates, hire them, and pay them. As Fintech Finderâ€™s lead developer, you have been tasked with integrating the Ethereum blockchain network into the application in order to enable your customers to instantly pay the fintech professionals whom they hire with cryptocurrency. In this Challenge, you will complete the code that enables your customers to send cryptocurrency payments to fintech professionals. To develop the code and test it out, you will assume the perspective of a Fintech Finder customer who is using the application to find a fintech professional and pay them for their work.

### Instructions:

Import Ethereum Transaction Functions into the Fintech Finder Application
Sign and Execute a Payment Transaction
Inspect the Transaction on Ganache

### Results:

Completed the notebooks to allow for integrating the Ethereum blockchain network into an application in order to enable customers to instantly pay the fintech professionals whom they hire with cryptocurrency. Unfortunately I came across some errors with running the application through the web interface due to an issue with my library i am currently operating on as seen in the screenshots below. With more time i would be able to troubleshoot and have this running perfectly as i believe my notebooks are completed correctly but as i was not able to surpass this error i was not able to varify the final outcome.
